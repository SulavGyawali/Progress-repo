Daily Python Progress repo

#Day 0
Today i discovered that you can create a "__call__" function to make an object callable. I used this while trying to replicate the "Typer" library in python as my first project in this journey. I learned how basic Typer functions and tried my best recreating as much as i understood. My goal for tomorrow is to implement the "--help" and other commands inside my cli.
